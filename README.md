# odoo-exercise
**Thank you for giving me this oppritunity to work for Odoo, this was a fun and tricky exercise**

**Things I would refactor if I was given more time**
- wrap grids in seperate containers to apply style across broad elements instead of verbose naming conventions
- refactor css naming conventions to make more readable and intuitive. 
- refactor grid and overlays, definetly the most time comsuming of the project, 
in retrospect I would overlay another grid on top of the base and split it into quadrents to make overlay boxes more accurate 
and scale by quarters. 
- I spent too much trying to override the default styings (header color specifically) given the timeframe (~5hours), I couldn't complete it
and had to move on.
