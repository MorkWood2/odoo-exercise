# odoo-exercise


**Thank you for giving me this oppritunity to work for Odoo, this was a fun and tricky exercise**


**My experience**

It certainly was tricky, espectially the overlaping boxes on the grid. I did not have enough time to fill out the design complelety (coloring and adding more numberous event boxes with unique styling) and the way I engineered the grid lead to complications with the toggle functionality.If I had more time I would refactor the code to keep it 'dry' and simply.  

**Things I would refactor if I was given more time**
-spend more time engineering how I would implement a solution through research and prototyping. 
- simplify simplify simplify js variables
- wrap grids in seperate containers to apply style across broad elements instead of verbose naming conventions
- refactor css naming conventions to make more readable and intuitive. 
- refactor grid and overlays completely, definetly the most time comsuming of the project, 
in retrospect I would overlay another grid on top of the base and split it into quadrents to make overlay boxes more accurate 
and scale by quarters. 
- I spent too much trying to override the default styings (header color specifically) given the timeframe (~5hours), I couldn't complete it
and had to move on. 




***Odoo question exercise*** 

> What do you find good/bad about this screen ?

I think it looks a little flat, adding subtle box-shadows,  bigger and more readable text, working in accordance with Google's Material Design style guide certainly wouldn't hurt and a concerted changed in color harmony. 

Functionally it looks like a great design. 



> What would you improve on it ?

Add some depth as well as increase the text size. Simplify color tags on event boxes, add subtle gradients and box shadows. 



> What would you change about it ?
I would use a library like React and Sass. 
Super helpful dependencies that would make the functionality easier to implement.
